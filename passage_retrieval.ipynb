They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye.

    "# Issues with the TF-IDF Approach in Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is a widely used method for lexical-based retrieval, motivated by assigning weights to terms based on their frequency within a document and their rarity across the corpus. Seversl limitations of TF-IDF are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TF-IDF relies purely on the occurrence of words and does not account for **synonyms, polysemy, or contextual meaning**. It treats words independently and does not capture relationships between different terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since TF-IDF scores are based on exact term matches, it fails when queries contain different **inflections, stemming variations, or paraphrasing**.\n",
    "3. TF-IDF defines a **high-dimensional vector space**, where each unique word in the corpus represents a separate dimension and often leads to **sparse representations**. The matrix becomes difficult to process efficiently as a fundtion of the vocabulary size. Also, short documents or queries term frequency is often low, which causes difficulties for small a corpus data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, any task including deeper-relations-understanding between the texts is less suited to be solved with /tf-/idf approaches.\n"

    "#### Potential Improvements for Retrieval Using an LLM\n",
    "Unlike traditional lexical-based approaches that rely only on exact term matching (TF-IDF), utilizing LLMs can capture contextual relationships between words, even when query and document vocabulary differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Potential Improvements:\n",
    "1. Metadata indexing (Both Semantic Search and Lexical Retrieval): An interesting approach is to define more-comprehensive ways for tagging and splitting the passages. For example, we can utilize NER for entity recognitions within each passage, making the search more specific while using meta-data index approaches (allowing the search to \"project\" and return results containing the keywords extracted from the query). Since NER or other tagging approaches are Semantic but the search is based on Lexical matching, this approaches can be considered as both Semanticcs and Lexical.\n",
    "2. Reranking approaches (Both Semantic Search and Lexical Retrieval): After retrieving top-k passages with MiniLM, apply a BERT-based cross-encoder that scores query-passage pairs for relevance. This applies to Semantic Search. We can utilize other ways Lexical approaches for reranking (for example, HITS algorithm).\n",
    "3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Combine retrieval with LLM-based generation by incorporating retrieved chunks into a final answer. This applies primarily for semantic search. Retrieval provides context for the LLM to generate more accurate, context-aware responses.\n",
    "4. Fine-tune LLMs (e.g., BERT, MiniLM) on a domain-specific corpus to improve the quality of passage embeddings.\n",
    "This improves semantic search accuracy by aligning embeddings more closely with the specific task.\n",

    "##### Limitations and Drawbacks:\n",
    "1. Computational Overhead: Using large-scale LLMs, especially in real-time retrieval systems, increases latency and computational costs.\n",
    "2. Hallucination Risk (for Generative Retrieval): Known drawback of LLMs' applications, where LLMs may hallucinate non-factual information, which can result in unreliable retrieval outputs (if not properly constrained).\n",
