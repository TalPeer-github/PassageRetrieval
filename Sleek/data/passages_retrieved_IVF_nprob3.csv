What is the Sorcererâ€™s Stone?,"There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).

""See?"" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. ""The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!""

""A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"" said Harry. ""No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.""

""And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,"" said Ron. ""He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?""","At last she found what she was looking for.

""I knew it! I knew it!""

""Are we allowed to speak yet?"" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.

""Nicolas Flamel,"" she whispered dramatically, ""is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!""

This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.

""The what?"" said Harry and Ron.

""Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there.""

She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.","""To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them."" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.

""Sir?"" said Harry. ""I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --""

""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""

""Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?""","Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.

Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.","A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.

""Morning,"" said Hagrid to a free goblin. ""We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.""

""You have his key, Sir?""

""Got it here somewhere,"" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.

""Got it,"" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

""That seems to be in order."""
How does Harry get into Gryffindor?,"Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....

And speaking of Snape...","Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.","Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.	Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin	would be learning together.

""Typical,"" said Harry darkly. ""Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.""

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

""You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,"" said Ron reasonably. ""Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.""","Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

""What have we got today?"" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

""Double Potions with the Slytherins,"" said Ron. ""Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.""

""Wish McGonagall favored us, "" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.",It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
What does the Mirror of Erised show Harry?,"She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.

""Mom?"" he whispered. ""Dad?""

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.","It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.

He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.

But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.","And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.

Except --

""So -- back again, Harry?""

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.

"" -- I didn't see you, sir.""

""Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,"" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.

""So,"" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, ""you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.""

""I didn't know it was called that, Sir.""

""But I expect you've realized by now what it does?""","""It -- well -- it shows me my family --""

""And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.""

""How did you know --?""

""I don't need a cloak to become invisible,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?""

Harry shook his head.

""Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?""

Harry thought. Then he said slowly, ""It shows us what we want... whatever we want...""","There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?

He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror."
Who helps Harry get past Fluffy?,"""This way!"" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

""RUN!"" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.","When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR,"" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to ""MacDougal, Morag.""

Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, ""SLYTHERIN!""

Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.

There weren't many people left now. ""Moon"" ""Nott"" ""Parkinson"" then a pair of twin girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil"" then ""Perks, Sally-Anne"" and then, at last -- ""Potter, Harry!""

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

""Potter, did she say?""

The Harry Potter?""","""Better get the cloak,"" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the common room.

""We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --""

""What are you doing?"" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.

""Nothing, Neville, nothing,"" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

""You're going out again,"" he said.

""No, no, no,"" said Hermione. ""No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?""","How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.

""Nearly there!"" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.

Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.

Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.

""Detention!"" she shouted. ""And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --""

""You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!""","They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.

""Where on earth have you all been?"" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

""Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,"" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.

""What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"" said Ron finally. ""If any dog needs exercise, that one does."""
What happens during Harryâ€™s first Quidditch match?,"It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.","As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.","Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying ""Voldemort"" without worrying.

""What's your Quidditch team?"" Ron asked.

""Er -- I don't know any,"" Harry confessed.

""What!"" Ron looked dumbfounded. ""Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --"" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.","""I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"" said Fred. ""We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.""

""Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.""

""Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.""

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

""Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?""

""You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,"" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.","nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. ""Well, that's it -- any questions?""

Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.

""We won't practice with the Snitch yet,"" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, ""it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these.""

He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.

Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on."
