What is the Sorcerer’s Stone?,"There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).

""See?"" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. ""The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!""

""A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"" said Harry. ""No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.""

""And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,"" said Ron. ""He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?""","At last she found what she was looking for.

""I knew it! I knew it!""

""Are we allowed to speak yet?"" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.

""Nicolas Flamel,"" she whispered dramatically, ""is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!""

This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.

""The what?"" said Harry and Ron.

""Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there.""

She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.","""Shhhh!"" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. ""Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?""

""There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,"" said Harry, ""about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --""

""SHHHH!"" said Hagrid again. ""Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh --""

""See you later, then,"" said Harry.

Hagrid shuffled off.

""What was he hiding behind his back?"" said Hermione thoughtfully.

""Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?""

""I'm going to see what section he was in,"" said Ron, who'd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.","When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called ""Who is it?"" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.

It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.

""So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?""

""Yes,"" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. ""We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy.""

Hagrid frowned at him.

""0' course I cant, he said. ""Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.""","""To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them."" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.

""Sir?"" said Harry. ""I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --""

""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""

""Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"""
How does Harry get into Gryffindor?,"Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....

And speaking of Snape...","Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.

After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.",It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.,"When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.

Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.

""Another year gone!"" Dumbledore said cheerfully. ""And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts....

""Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.""","Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

""What have we got today?"" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

""Double Potions with the Slytherins,"" said Ron. ""Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true.""

""Wish McGonagall favored us, "" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before."
What does the Mirror of Erised show Harry?,"She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.

Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.

""Mom?"" he whispered. ""Dad?""

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.","""It -- well -- it shows me my family --""

""And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.""

""How did you know --?""

""I don't need a cloak to become invisible,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?""

Harry shook his head.

""Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?""

Harry thought. Then he said slowly, ""It shows us what we want... whatever we want...""","And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.

Except --

""So -- back again, Harry?""

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.

"" -- I didn't see you, sir.""

""Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,"" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.

""So,"" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, ""you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.""

""I didn't know it was called that, Sir.""

""But I expect you've realized by now what it does?""","Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.

""You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,"" said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.

Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (""If Filch had caught you!""), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.","The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, ""I'll come back,"" and hurried from the room.

""You could have woken me up,"" said Ron, crossly.

""You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.

""I'd like to see your mom and dad,"" Ron said eagerly.

""And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone."""
Who helps Harry get past Fluffy?,"""This way!"" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

""RUN!"" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.","""Better get the cloak,"" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the common room.

""We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --""

""What are you doing?"" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.

""Nothing, Neville, nothing,"" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

""You're going out again,"" he said.

""No, no, no,"" said Hermione. ""No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?""","""I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.""

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.

""Don' mention it,"" said Hagrid gruffly. ""Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.""

A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.","On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.","They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.

""Where on earth have you all been?"" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

""Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,"" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.

""What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"" said Ron finally. ""If any dog needs exercise, that one does."""
What happens during Harry’s first Quidditch match?,"It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.

Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.","As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.","Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying ""Voldemort"" without worrying.

""What's your Quidditch team?"" Ron asked.

""Er -- I don't know any,"" Harry confessed.

""What!"" Ron looked dumbfounded. ""Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --"" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.","The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.

""You've got to eat some breakfast.""

""I don't want anything.""

""Just a bit of toast,"" wheedled Hermione.

""I'm not hungry.""

Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.

""Harry, you need your strength,"" said Seamus Finnigan. ""Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.""

""Thanks, Seamus,"" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.

By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.","""I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"" said Fred. ""We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.""

""Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school.""

""Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.""

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

""Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?""

""You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,"" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl."
"How do Harry, Ron, and Hermione manage to bypass each of the obstacles guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone?","They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.

'Yes!""

Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.

""Oh, no,"" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.

""It's the girls' bathroom!"" Harry gasped.

""Hermione!"" they said together.

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.","Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.

They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.

""Ready?"" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.

The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.","""Confuse it!"" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.

""Oy, pea-brain!"" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.

""Come on, run, run!"" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.","Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. ""Well, it's true,"" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, ""If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team....""

""So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?"" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.

""I thought you weren't speaking to us?"" said Harry.

""Yes, don't stop now,"" said Ron, ""it's doing us so much good.""

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.","The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.

""We must be miles under the school , she said.

""Lucky this plant thing's here, really,"" said Ron.

""Lucky!"" shrieked Hermione. ""Look at you both!""

She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.

Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.

""Stop moving!"" Hermione ordered them. ""I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare!"""
what role does Fluffy play in the protection system?,"Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. ""It's either really valuable or really dangerous,"" said Ron. ""Or both,"" said Harry.


But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.

Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.","Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.

""If you want to go back, I won't blame you,"" he said. ""You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.""

""Don't be stupid,"" said Ron.

""We're coming,"" said Hermione.

Harry pushed the door open.

As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.

""What's that at its feet?"" Hermione whispered.

""Looks like a harp,"" said Ron. ""Snape must have left it there.""

""It must wake up the moment you stop playing,"" said Harry. ""Well, here goes...""

He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.","Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.

""AAAAAAAAAARGH!""

Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.

Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.","""Better get the cloak,"" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing.

He ran back down to the common room.

""We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --""

""What are you doing?"" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.

""Nothing, Neville, nothing,"" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.

Neville stared at their guilty faces.

""You're going out again,"" he said.

""No, no, no,"" said Hermione. ""No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?""","They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.

""Where on earth have you all been?"" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

""Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,"" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.

""What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"" said Ron finally. ""If any dog needs exercise, that one does."""
Snape’s and Quirrell’s interference Harrys first quidditch match,"""He's just made that rule up,"" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. ""Wonder what's wrong with his leg?""

""Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,"" said Ron bitterly.

The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (""How will you learn?""), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.

Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.

""Better you than me,"" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.

He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.","The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.

""I'm going to play,"" he told Ron and Hermione. ""If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.""

""Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,"" said Hermione.

As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?","Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.

""Will you stop messing around!"" he yelled. ""That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!""

George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.

""Snape's refereeing?"" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. ""When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.""

The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.

""It's not my fault,"" said Wood. ""We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us.""

Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....","It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.

""All right -- all right --"" he heard Quirrell sob.

Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.

All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.

Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.","""Idiot boy!"" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. ""I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?""

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.

""Take him up to the hospital wing,"" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.

""You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.""

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.

""Doi* push it,"" he muttered, ""I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."""
